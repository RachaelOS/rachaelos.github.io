								<li><b>Network Performance Graduate | </b>September 2023 - Present</li>
								<ul class="bullets">
									<li><b>Led a project</b> with no budget, coordinating with multiple teams to implement a new architecture solution for automating incident resolutions within 
										the network. Optimised the use of an existing tool, increasing efficiency in resolving network issues.</li>
									<li>Initiated a <b>knowledge management process</b> within the OSS teams, enabling more efficient problem-solving and reducing repeated mistakes across 
										teams.</li>
									<li><b>Developed monitoring scripts</b> using Gawk/Bash to ensure key teams were notified if the monitoring tool stopped working or provided early warnings 
										of potential issues.</li>
									<li>Created a <b>Python application</b> to scrape data from a company benefits website, allowing employees to easily compare car prices. Features included 
										customisable price alerts, graphing, and Excel-based price tracking.</li>
										<ul class="sub">
											<li> Engaged with managers to gather requirements, incorporated user feedback, and documented the script's development process for company-wide 
												understanding.</li>
										</ul>
									<li><b>Managed vendor relationships</b> and led the development of dashboards for monitoring incidents, which was then used in weekly and monthly meetings 
										with external teams to improve performance observability.</li>
									<li><b>Delivered all-hands presentations</b> to department members, explaining project achievements, departmental goals, and areas for focus</li>
								</ul>

								<li><b>University Research Projects </b>2021 - 2023</li>
								<ul class="bullets">
									<li>Developed a Python-based polynomial fitting method to reduce fluorescent interference
										and improve the signal-to-noise ratio for a Raman Spectrometer, aiding a future NASA
										Europa Lander mission.</li>
									<li>Produced global temperature maps and analysed wind velocity patterns on Jupiter, using
										Python and a Linux graphical interface to process and calibrate data. These maps were
										then used for further research papers by my project supervisor</li>
