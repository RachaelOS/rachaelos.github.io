									<li><b>C# and XAML:</b> I made this game to learn how to use C#, this was my 
										first time using the language. The .cs behind-code allows the buttons to 
										function, the game to calculate player hands, creating a deck of cards, 
										calculating scores and printing the text. Also transitioning the images. 
										XAML was used to structure the pages.</li>
									<li><b>Github:</b> I used Git version control and repository to make updates to the app and 
										allowed me to work across multiple devices.</li>
									<li><b>.NET MAUI:</b> I used the .NET MAUI framework in Visual Studio 2022 to develop
										the app. This has allowed me to make a cross-platform game which I have successfully 
										exported and downloaded onto my phone.</li>
									<li><b>Procreate Dreams:</b> Procreate Dreams was  used to create the artwork for the game. 
										I plan to use this to also create animations for the characters.</li>
									<li><b>To improve:</b> This is v1 of the app, would like to make updates to improve it further. 
										When you exit the game page whilst certain processes are running, it crashes the game. I'd 
										like to update the app so that it can exit any running tasks cleanly. I would also like to 
										ensure that the layout of the game works across all platforms, currently windows and certain 
										mobile devices do not format as expected meaning certain elements are missing. I would also 
										like to make the game more immersive and entertaining by adding animations to the characters 
										and a more aesthetic update to the text showing the user what is happening.</li>

											<li><b>Python and html:</b> I created this dashboard using Python with the Dash library. I also 
												used embedded HTML to structure the graphs/tables which were created using Plotly. Pandas was 
												used for reading data from multiple excel files and creating a dataframe.</li>
											<li><b>Usability:</b> The information at the top of the dashboard (seen in the first image) provides 
												context for the user, such as the date range calculated from the excel files. I have included summary 
												data as well. The graphs are also interactive - you can isolate one car to look at the price changes 
												over time. You can also hover the mouse over any of the graphs and pie chart to get specific info.</li>
											<li><b>Cleaning data from multiple excel files:</b> Using Pandas I ensured the data was cleaned so that it could be 
												manipulated and so the analysis made sense. Any overlapping data from the multiple excel sheets is managed by 
												only using data from a sheet specified by the user. It is also able to work with null fields and blank fields.</li>
											<li><b>Customer criteria and feedback:</b> This dashboard was created using requests from the users of the web 
												scraping script I developed (see below). I developed the dashboard to be able to answer questions they had 
												about the data and insights they wanted to know. I also ensured to make all of these easy to understand in 
												the dashboard. I iteratively released versions of the dashboard and collected feedback to make improvements.</li>

									<li><b>Python:</b> I used Selenium for web scraping and Pandas for manipulating the data, and reading/writing excel sheets.</li>
									<li><b>Usability:</b> Based on feedback provided from pre-release versions of the script I ensured that the script is easy to 
										use and the actions it takes are clearly presented to the user in the terminal, and any errors are presented in 
										a user-friendly way. Details of these errors are stored in a file for troubleshooting. The aim of this script was 
										to work in the background and not interrupt the work of the user, which was managed successfully by having the 
										interface be a simple terminal which requires no interaction from the user. Any useful information is then 
										presented through notifications or in an excel file. The user can also customise what data is scraped by entering details in a .txt file.</li>
									<li><b>Web Scraping:</b> This script is able to login to the users Rewards account (using credentials written in a .txt file) and navigates to the relevant site. It then scrapes data for every car on their page, while being able</li>
									<li><b>Writing data to an excel file: </b>Once the data is collected into a dataframe, this can be used to write 4 
										sheets in a spreadsheet. The first is a table containing the prices for each car on each date that the 
										script is ran. This is updated with every run of the script. This is then used to plot a graph of the 
										prices for the cars over time. The lead times are also scraped and this is presented on a separate page. 
										Finally, an overview page is created explaining the data, presenting the version of the script being used 
										and shows the cheapest car, shortest lead time and which cars have newly been added or removed since the 
										last scrape.</li>
									<li><b>Notifications: </b>The drops in price of the newly scraped cars compared to the previous date's prices is calculated. The cars with a price drop greater than or equal to a value defined by the user are identified, and notifications for these cars appear (as shown in the image above).</li>

										<li><b>Python:</b> Tkinter and Selenium were used for this.</li>
										<li><b>Web Scraping: </b>On YouTube I had created playlists of videos to learn about each hobby. When the "videos" 
											button is clicked, the video titles and links are scraped from the relevant playlist and presented to the user.</li>
										<li><b>Popups: </b> Each button generates a popup with the relevant info or links. The prompts randomly generate an 
											idea and the music quiz randomly generates a question popup containing a button which presents the answer.</li>
										<li><b>Interactive: You can add items to the to do list and check them off. It is easy to navigate the buttons and decide which 
											prompts/ideas you want. You can also adjust the borders of the sections of the dashboard.</b></li>
										<li><b>Improvements: If I were to do this again I would probably use C# with .NET as this makes it much easier to create a dashboard which 
											would avoid some of the glitchy features this dashboard had.</b></li>

											<li><b>Godot Game Engine:</b> The Godot game engine and Godot's own programming language were 
												used to create this game. I followed a YouTube tutorial to learn the basics and used their 
												artwork to create the game. I could then move on to create my own features for the game.</li>
											<li><b>Game Features: </b>The character is able to move left and right and jump. If the character dies, the game automatically restarts. The player can collect coins, potions and collide with enemies, causing the player to die. The player wins by collecting all of the coins, which generates a message on screen.</li>
											<li><b>Animations: </b> The animations were created in the Godot game engine using multiple sprites to create an animation. For the character, there is a stationary animation, moving animation, jump animation and dying animation. For the coins, they have a rotating animation. Enemies have a walking animation.</li>
